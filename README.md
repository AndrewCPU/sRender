# sRender


Just a note, another repo will be up later today that contains bare minumum code to make 3D graphics with Java.

Hi! So this is a program that renders a 3D world, does basic world generation as well as some lighting calculations. 
here are particles, and an inventory system.

You will also find faries coming out of the light blocks around the island.
(You can spawn faries by pressing 'F')

Give it a Watch / Star if that makes you happy.
